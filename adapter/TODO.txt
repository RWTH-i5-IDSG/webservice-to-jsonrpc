	+: new feature idea
	*: DONE
	
======

	* Filter json-rpc header so that it is not sent as a header to WS
	* Build a manager servlet for the adapter
	* Check if method available at WS
------
	# Create a HTML page with operation details for each adapter 
	# Check if params are correct for method 
	(This is not critical because if params are not correct WS will send a Soap Fault anyway. 
	Then the user can adapt the request.)
------	
	+ Store in web.xml more than one wsdlUrl variable, so that routes for these 
	are created during initialization and therefore only one servlet is used.
